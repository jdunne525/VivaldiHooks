This project used to contain various hooks for Vivaldi and a method of loading them as written by justdanpo / VivaldiHooks.  

New version as of 9/6/2024:
The old multiline-tabs stopped working in September 2024, so I'm changing to a new version created by Hababr on the vivaldi forums.  
At this point this repo is just storing whatever version I'm currently using of this script.
Code is from here:
https://forum.vivaldi.net/post/706823

Instructions for how to install multiline-tabs:
* Open vivaldi://experiments
* Enable "Allow for using CSS modifications"
* Open Appearance section in settings
* Choose the folder you want to use
* Place your CSS files inside it
* Restart Vivaldi to see them in effect
