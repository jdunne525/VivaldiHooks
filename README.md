This project used to contain various hooks for Vivaldi and a method of loading them as written by justdanpo / VivaldiHooks.  

Vivaldi at some point added an option to allow CSS modifications, which makes this project easier to use and maintain.
At this point I've decided to clean everything out and just leave the multiline-tabs.css which is the only "hook" I still use.
The multi-line tabs implementation is still working very well as of 8/18/2022.

See the following thread for other implementations:
https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/25453/multiple-row-tabs/177?lang=en-US&page=9


* Open vivaldi://experiments
* Enable "Allow for using CSS modifications"
* Open Appearance section in settings
* Choose the folder you want to use
* Place your CSS files inside it
* Restart Vivaldi to see them in effect
